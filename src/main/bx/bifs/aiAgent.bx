	 * Create an AI Agent with optional configuration

	 * An AI Agent is an autonomous entity that can:
	 * - Reason through complex problems
	 * - Use tools to gather information or take actions
	 * - Maintain conversation memory across interactions
	 * - Execute multi-step tasks with planning
	 * - Chain operations in pipelines
	 * - Delegate tasks to sub-agents
	 *
	 * @name The agent's name (default: "BxAi")
	 * @description The agent's role/purpose description
	 * @instructions System instructions for the agent's behavior
	 * @model The AI model provider to use. Defaults to configured default model
	 * @memory Single IAiMemory instance or array of memory instances, defaults to WindowMemory
	 * @tools Array of Tool objects the agent can use
	 * @subAgents Array of sub-agents to register as internal tools for delegation
	 * @params Additional provider parameters (model,temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
	 * @options Additional options (timeout, logging, etc.)
	 *
	 * @return AiAgent instance for fluent chaining
